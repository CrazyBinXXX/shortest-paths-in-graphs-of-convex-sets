# shortest-paths-in-graphs-of-convex-sets

This repository contains the python code necessary to reproduce the numerical results in the paper [**"Shortest Paths in Graphs of Convex Sets" by Tobia Marcucci, Jack Umenberger, Pablo A. Parrilo, and Russ Tedrake**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.11565).
Optimization problems are solved using [**Drake**](https://drake.mit.edu) as an interface to the solver [**Mosek**](https://www.mosek.com) (free for academic use).
A mature high-performance implementation of the shortest-path algorithm from the paper is under development in [**Drake's main project**](https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake).
