# shortest-paths-in-graphs-of-convex-sets

This repository contains the code and the notebooks necessary to reproduce the numerical results in the paper "Shortest Paths in Graphs of Convex Sets" by Tobia Marcucci, Jack Umenberger, Pablo A. Parrilo, and Russ Tedrake.
A mature high-performance implementation of the shortest-path algorithm from the paper is under development in https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake.
